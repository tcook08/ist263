    My name is Tory Cook, and I am majoring in information management and technology with a concentration of information security. I am interested in exploring how systems and tools function and protecting peopleâ€™s privacy. This summer, I completed an internship in the IT department of the Seneca Nation on the Cattaraugus Territory, which was a big accomplishment of mine. Outside of work, I love reading, playing volleyball, and playing video games.
