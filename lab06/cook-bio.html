        <h1>Tory's Biography</h1>
        <h2>Junior at Syracuse University</h2>
    <p>My name is Tory Cook, and I am majoring in information management and technology with a concentration of information security.
    I am interested in exploring how systems and tools function and protecting peopleâ€™s privacy. This summer, I completed an internship 
    in the IT department of the Seneca Nation on the Cattaraugus Territory, which was a big accomplishment of mine.
    Outside of work, I <strong> love </strong> reading, playing volleyball, and playing video games.</p>
