        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Tory Cook, and I am Seneca from the Cattaraugus Territory.
            My goal of this website is to share a part of my culture that I take a lot of pride in. 
            My grandma taught me how to bead my first pair of earrings at the age of 14.
            I grew up surrounded by beaded jewlery, regalia, and decorations that reflect a sense of belonging for me.</p>
