                <h2>Nya:WëhSgëno', I'm Tory</h2>
                <p> My name is Tory Cook, and I am currently a junior at Syracuse University. My major is 
                information management and technology with a concentration of information security. I
                am Seneca from the Cattaraugus Territory located near Buffalo, NY. My goal of this website
                is to share a part of my culture that I take a lot of pride in. I learned how to bead my first
                pair of earrings at age 14, and I would attend beading classes with my grandma.
                I grew up in a community where beadwork reflects a sense of pride and identity and worn confidently.
                That environment inspired me to show my perspective of beadwork that I see as art and identity.
