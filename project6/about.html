        <h2>Nya:WëhSgëno', I'm Tory</h2>
        <p> My name is Tory Cook, and I am currently a junior at Syracuse University. My major is 
            information management and technology with a concentration of information security. I
            am Seneca from the Cattaraugus Territory located near Buffalo, NY. MY goal of this website
            is to share a part of my culture that I take a lot of pride in. I learned how to bead my first
            pair of earrings at age 14, and I would attend beading classes with my grandma.
            I grew up in a community where beadwork reflects a sense of pride and identity and worn confidently.
            That environment inspired me to show my perspective of beadwork that I see as art and identity.
